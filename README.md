# terrainlayer
I just made some changes to the terrain layer module for foundry vtt.

I didn't like the look of the weird mountain, so I changed it the corss hatches that only show up when a token is being moved, or if the switch to show them all the time is toggled.
I also shifted the toggle button to the bottom so it remained consistent.
And boosted up the zIndex so it showed above Tiles.

Removed the minus button as the right click does the job.

All credit for the module itself goes to the original author.
